This is a simple NFT minting dApp which uses a Polygon ID off-chain verification process to allow certain identities to mint NFT. The demo uses some dummy verification schema and dummy NFT contract.

The main idea behind this demo project is to combine Polygon ID issuers, verifiers, and specific schemas for publishing AI models as NFTs.
